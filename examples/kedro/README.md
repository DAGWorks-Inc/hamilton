# Kedro & Hamilton

This repository compares how to build dataflows with Kedro and Hamilton.

> see the [side-by-side comparison](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/code-comparisons/kedro/) in the Hamilton documentation

## Content
- `kedro-code/` includes code from the [Kedro Spaceflight tutorial](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial_template.html).
- `hamilton-code/` is a refactor of `kedro-code/` using the Hamilton framework.

Each directory contains a `README` with instructions on how to run the code. We suggest going through the Kedro code first, and then read the Hamilton refactor.
