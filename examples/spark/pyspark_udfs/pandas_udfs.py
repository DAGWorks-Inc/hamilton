"""Pandas UDFs.

Has to only contain map operations! Aggregations, filters, etc. are not supported.

Notes:

1. Functions that are annotated with pd.Series for all inputs and output, will be converted to pandas UDFs.
Note - we could broaden support for more function type signatures, but this is a good start. Please make an
issue/discussion if this is something you'd like to see.
2. You need to use the `h_typing.column` annotation for the output type. This is because we need to know what
underlying primitive type the pandas series is. This is a limitation of the pandas UDFs on pyspark.
3. If a function is deemed to be a pandas_udf one, Hamilton will try to satisfy running these UDFs with columns from
the dataframe ONLY. This is different from how the vanilla UDFs behave. This is partially a limitation of pandas UDFs.
4. Pandas_udfs operate over chunks of data, and can thus operate in a vectorized manner. This is a big performance gain
over vanilla UDFs.
5. You can have non-pandas_udf functions in the same file, and will be run as row based UDFs.
