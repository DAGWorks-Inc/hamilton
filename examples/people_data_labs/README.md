# People Data Labs

[People Data Labs](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/) is a data provider that offers several data APIs for person enrichment & search, company enrichment & search, and IP enrichment.

This example showcases how Hamilton can help you write modular data transformations.

## Content
- `notebook.ipynb` is a step-by-step introduction to Hamilton. Start there.
- `analysis.py` contains data transformations used by `run.py`. They're the same as the ones defined in `notebook.ipynb`.
- `run.py` contains code to execute the analysis.


## Set up
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it
    ```console
    python -m venv venv && . venv/bin/active
    ```

2. Install requirements
    ```console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the data with this command (it should take ~3mins)
    ```console
    python download_data.py
    ```

4. Visit the notebook or execute the script
    ```console
    python run.py
    ```
