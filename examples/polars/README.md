# Classic Hamilton Hello World

In this example we show you how to create a simple hello world dataflow that
creates a polars dataframe as a result. It performs a series of transforms on the
input to create columns that appear in the output.

File organization:

* `my_functions.py` houses the logic that we want to compute.
Note (1) how the functions are named, and what input
parameters they require. That is how we create a DAG modeling the dataflow we want to happen.
* `my_script.py` houses how to get Hamilton to create the DAG, specifying that we want a polars dataframe and
exercise it with some inputs.

To run things:
```bash
> python my_script.py
```

# Caveat with Polars
There is one major caveat with Polars to be aware of: THERE IS NO INDEX IN POLARS LIKE THERE IS WITH PANDAS.

What this means is that when you tell Hamilton to execute and return a polars dataframe if you are using the
provided results builder ('hamilton.plugins.polars_implementations.PolarsResultsBuilder'), then you will have to
ensure the row order matches the order you expect for all the outputs you request. E.g. if you do a filter, or a sort,
or a join, or a groupby, you will have to ensure that when you ask Hamilton to materialize an output that it's in the
order you expect.
