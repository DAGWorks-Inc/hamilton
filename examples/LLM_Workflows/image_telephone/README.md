See the [streamlit app](https://image-telephone.streamlit.app) for documentation.

This example uses dataflows from the hub to do something fun with image captioning and generation.
Note that hamilton code is used rather than defined here.

There are two files in this:

1. generate_images.ipynb
2. streamlit.py

The first is a notebook that generates images and captions, and the second is a streamlit app that displays them.
