# Tracking telemetry in Hamilton UI for Ray clusters

We show the ability to combine the [RayGraphAdapter](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/reference/graph-adapters/RayGraphAdapter/) and [HamiltonTracker](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/concepts/ui/) to run a dummy DAG.

# ray_lineage.py
Has three dummy functions:
- waiting 5s
- waiting 1s
- raising an error

That represent a basic DAG.

# run_lineage.py
Is where the driver code lives to create the DAG and exercise it.

To exercise it:
> Have an open instance of Hamilton UI: https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/concepts/ui/

```bash
python -m run_lineage.py
Usage: python -m run_lineage.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  project_id      This command will select the created project in Hamilton UI
  username  This command will input the correct username to access the selected project_id
```
