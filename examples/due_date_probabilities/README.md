# Modeling Pregnancy Due Dates using Hamilton

This is an example of developing and applying a simple statistical model using Hamilton
for a very common problem. What is the probability that a baby will be born (before, on, after)
X date?


You can find the notebook on google collab here:

You can read the full description in the [post](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/181bb751-2e58-4e76-8d53-5a8c81ea16cb).

In this, you'll find the following files:

1. [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) - The Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of developing/running the model.
2. [base_dates.py] -- a Hamilton module that generates date-related series
3. [probability_estimation.py] -- a Hamilton module that computes a statistical model (estimating parameters for probability due dates)
4. [probabilities.py] -- a Hamilton module that runs that model over a set of dates

Run the notebook to see the process of developing the model and running it.
