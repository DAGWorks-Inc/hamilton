> Hamilton dataflow materialization plan

## File structure

The Hamilton refactor achieves the same data transformations. The project fits in essentially 2 files:
- `dataflow.py` contains regular Python functions to define the dataflow (equivalent to Dagster `tutorial/assets.py`).
- `run.py` contains the "driver code" to load and execute the dataflow (equivalent to Dagster `tutorial/__init__.py`).

The directory also include `mock_api.py` which simulates a `ressource` in the Dagster tutorial, and `dataflow.png` which is an artifact generated by the Hamilton `Driver`.

## Instructions
1. Run the code
    ```console
    python run.py
    ```
