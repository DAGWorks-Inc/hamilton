# Jaffle shop

This repository is a reimplementation of the canonical [dbt example jaffle_shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop). It illustrates data transformations for an ecommerce store.

Data transformations are implemented using the Python library [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) which allows to define SQL operations that works across backends. By default, it uses [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) for local development. Hamilton + Ibis provides a Python-centric alternative to dbt ([Learn more](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/integrations/ibis/)).

## Content
The content and structure aims to match the [original dbt `jaffle_shop`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop/tree/main) example. On the other hand, Hamilton is just a Python library and is flexible regarding project structure.

- `data/`: samples data; equivalent to `seeds/` in the dbt repo.
- `dataflows/staging` load raw data and rename columns to avoid naming conflicts; equivalent to `models/staging/` in the dbt repo.
- `dataflows/customer_flow.py` and `dataflows/order_flow.py` define data transformations; equivalent to `models/customers.sql` and `models/orders.sql` in the dbt repo.
- `run.py` specify where to load data from and how to execute dataflows.

 Genrally, you'll notice Hamilton aims to reduce the sprawl of configurations (`.yaml`) and documentation (`.md`). Instead, it uses docstrings, type hints, or Python object to couple them to with your code (`.py`).

## Set up
1. create and activate virtual environment

    ```script
    python -m venv venv & . venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. install requirements

    ```script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. execute the Hamilton dataflow

    ```script
    python run.py
    ```
