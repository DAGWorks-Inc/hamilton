"""
Here are some features that are based on the absenteeism data set.
They are just supposed to be illustrative of the kind of features one might have.

Note (1): we use check_output to warn us if the output is not what we expect; this is
used in both the offline ETL and the online webservice. Use `check_output` to help
encode your expectations about the output of your functions and catch bugs early!

Note (2): we use @config to remove age_mean and age_std_dev from being computed in the online context.
This means they need to be satisfied by either being passed in, or having another module define them.
We do the latter for this example, but having online_loader define them.
