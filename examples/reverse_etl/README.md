# Reverse ETL for your timesheets

This example shows how to create a timesheet from time tracking data generated by the command line tool [Timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) and upload it to Google Sheets.

## Content
1. `notebook.ipynb` explains the code step-by-step and allows you to interact and modify the dataflow.
2. `upload_timesheet.py` contains the same dataflow but as a script. It can be used as a [Timewarrior extension](https://timewarrior.net/docs/api/) directly, see below.

## Set up
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it
    ```console
    python -m venv venv && . venv/bin/active
    ```

2. Install requirements
    ```console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Timewarrior extension
Adding a [Timewarrior extension](https://timewarrior.net/docs/api/) means you can trigger arbitrary scripts with `timew report SCRIPT_FILE_NAME`. Even better, you can skip the `report` command and only type the `SCRIPT_FILE_NAME` partially if it's unambiguous. For example, you can trigger `upload_timesheet.py` with `timew upload`.

To enable this, follow these steps:
1. Identify your Timewarrior installation directory (we'll assume the default: `~/.timewarrior`)
2. Copy `upload_timesheet.py` from this example to `~/.timewarrior/extensions`
3. Create a `credentials.json` with credentials for the Google Sheets API ([see step-by-step guide](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-use-the-google-sheets-api-with-python)) under `~/.timewarrior/extensions`. It should look like this:

    ```json
    credentials = {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "...",
        "private_key_id": "...",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ...",
        "client_email": "... .iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "...",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/ ...",
        "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
    }
    ```
4. Enable execution permissions with `chmod +x upload_timesheet.py`
5. Verify the extension is enabled with `timew extensions`. You should see

    ```console
    Extensions located in:
        ~/.timewarrior/extensions

    Extension        Status
    credentials.json No executable
    upload_timesheet.py Active
    ```
6. Get the `spreadsheet_id` from the Google Sheets URL `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/$SPREADSHEET_ID/edit?gid=0#gid=0`
7. Add the `spreadsheet_id` as a Timewarrior config point via `timew config spreadsheet_id $SPREADSHEET_ID`
8. Use the command `timew report upload_timesheet.py` to test it out! You should be able to shorten it to `timew upload`

> [!NOTE]
> Try to run `python upload_timesheet.py` will hang because it will to read values from `sys.stdin` which would be provided by the Timewarrior CLI.
