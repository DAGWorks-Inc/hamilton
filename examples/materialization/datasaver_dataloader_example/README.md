# @datasaver and @dataloader example

This example shows you can use the
`@datasaver` and `@dataloader` decorators to
annotated functions that save and load data so that they
can also return metadata.

This metadata is then exposed in the Hamilton UI / inspectable
by other adapters.

To run this example, you can use the following command:

1. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Have the Hamilton UI set up. See [UI docs](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/hamilton-ui/) for instructions.
3. You have modified the run.py / notebook to log to the right Hamilton UI project.
4. Run the example:

```bash
python run.py
```
or via the notebook.
