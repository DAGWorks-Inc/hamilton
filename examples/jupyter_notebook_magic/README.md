# Hamilton notebook extension

One of the best part about notebooks is the ability to execute and immediately inspect results. They provide a "read-eval-print" loop (REPL) coding experience. However, the way Hamilton separates dataflow definition (functions in a module) from execution (building and executing a driver) creates an extra step that can slowdown this loop.

We built the Hamilton notebook extension to tighten that loop and even give a better experience than the core notebook experience!

For a [video overview click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZT2ur2jg8&t=288s).

To load the magic:
```python
%load_ext hamilton.plugins.jupyter_magic
```

For example, this would allow you to define the module `joke` from your notebook

```python
%%cell_to_module joke --display
def topic() -> str:
    return "Cowsay"

def joke_prompt(topic: str) -> str:
    return f"Knock, knock. Who's there? {topic}"

def reply(joke_prompt: str) -> str:
    _, _, right = joke_prompt.partition("? ")
    return f"{right} who?"
```

To exercise this example you can run it in Google Colab too:
