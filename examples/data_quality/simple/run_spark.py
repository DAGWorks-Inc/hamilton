"""
This script runs a Hamilton DAG whose intent is to create some features for input to a model.
The way the code is set up, is that you can do one thing:

1. It uses Pandas on Spark to parallelize & scale computation. Use {"execution": "spark"} for this mode.

The model fitting steps are not represented here, just the feature ingestion and transformation logic.

Using Spark only makes sense if you hit "big data" scale. Otherwise, it's a lot of overhead for little value.

To run:
> python run_spark.py
