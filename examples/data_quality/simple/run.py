"""
This script runs a Hamilton DAG whose intent is to create some features for input to a model.
The model fitting steps are not represented here, just the feature ingestion and transformation logic.

Use this way if all your data can fit in memory, and multiprocessing would result in too much overhead (try using Ray
locally as a way to determine whether it is).
Don't bother scaling until you really need to!

To run:
> python run.py
