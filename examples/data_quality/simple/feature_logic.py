"""
This module defines some feature transformation logic that we'd like to apply.
It then in addition, decorates the functions with @check_output, so that at runtime, we can
execute a validator against the output of the function. The default is to log a warning, unless `importance='fail'`
is specified. In which case, it will halt execution.

Note:
    (1) to handle running on dask, ray, and spark, you will see some `@config.when*` decorators, which will
    determine whether this function should exist or not depending on some configuration passed in.
    (2) instead of @config.when* we could instead move these functions into specific independent modules, and then in
    the driver choose which one to use for the DAG. For the purposes of this example, we decided one file is simpler.
    (3) As of the 1.9.0 release, Hamilton, by default, does not handle data frame validation. Please use the Pandera
    integration - see `examples/data_quality/pandera` for an example.
