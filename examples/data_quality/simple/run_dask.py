"""
This script runs a Hamilton DAG whose intent is to create some features for input to a model.
The way the code is set up, is that you can do two things:

1. It uses Dask to parallelize computation. Use {"execution": "normal"} for this mode.
2. It uses Dask to parallelize computation and scale the data. It does this latter part by changing the way data
is loaded. Use {"execution": "dask"} for this mode. Note: the current validators implemented do not support dask
data types just yet.

The model fitting steps are not represented here, just the feature ingestion and transformation logic.

Use (1) if all your data can fit in memory, and you want to parallelize execution.
Use (2) if you need to scale to "big data" set sizes.

To run:
> python run_dask.py
