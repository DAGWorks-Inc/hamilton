"""
This script runs a Hamilton DAG whose intent is to create some features for input to a model.
The way the code is set up, is that you can do one thing:

1. It uses Ray to parallelize computation. Use {"execution": "normal"} for this mode.

The model fitting steps are not represented here, just the feature ingestion and transformation logic.

Use (1) if all your data can fit in memory, and you want to parallelize execution.
With (1) you can scale to data larger than on a laptop - you'll just be limited to the individual memory size of the
machines in the Ray cluster you are running on.

To run:
> python run_ray.py
