# Overview

This code accompanies the "Write once, run everywhere" blog post. While it represents the
same fundamental concepts as the other feature engineering example, its simplified to demonstrate a few contexts.
You should be able to download this and easily adapt it to your own use-cases

# Structure

There are two scripts in this example
1. [online.py](contexts/online.py) -- meant to simulate an online server
2. [etl.py](contexts/batch.py) -- meant to simulate a batch ETL

Then we have the individual code in components.py, separated into:
1. [features.py](components/features.py) -- runs the map operations to generate the final features
2. [joins.py](components/join_operations.py) -- runs the join operations on the way to generating the features
3. [aggregations.py](components/aggregation_operations.py) -- runs the aggregation operations on the way to generating the features
4. [data_loaders.py](components/data_loaders.py) -- loads up data externally
5. [model.py](components/model.py) -- runs the model on the features

As well as a [utility file](components/utils.py) that contains some helper functions. These are mock functions to load the data.

We have chosen to place the batch/online code in the same module to make comparing easier to compare/show how one could use -- there is online/batch code in all three of these.
That said, the alternative (separating out by modules) could make sense as well.

# Running the code

Run the online.py file with:

```bash
python -m contexts.online
Usage: python -m contexts.online [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  serve      This command will start the server
  visualize  This command will visualize execution
```

And run the batch file with:

```bash
python -m contexts.batch
Usage: python -m contexts.batch [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run        This command will run the ETL, and print it out to the terminal
  visualize  This command will visualize execution
```
# Adapting to your use-case

As you've noticed, rather than implementing a model/data loading functionality (this varies by use-case),
we have exposed mock functions. To adapt this to your (real-world) use-case, you'll want to:


1. Change the functions in [utils.py](components/utils.py) to load your data, *or* make [data_loaders.py](components/data_loaders.py) utilize the `load_from`
2. Change to use your features by modifying, adding, and removing functions
3. Use an actual model! Change [model.py](components/model.py) to load your pretrained model, or make it do something interesting with the input data
