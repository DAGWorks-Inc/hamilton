""""
This is a simple example of a FastAPI server that uses Hamilton on the request
path to transform the data into features, and then uses a fake model to make
a prediction.

The assumption here is that you need to go to a feature store to get RAW data, and in
the request you've only been passed
(alternatively if everything is in the feature store, you can skip the Hamilton step).

For the aggregation features, we load them from the feature store in this example.
