"""
Here are some features that are based on the absenteeism data set.
They are just supposed to be illustrative of the kind of features one might have.

Note (1): we use check_output to warn us if the output is not what we expect; this is
used in both the offline ETL and the online webserivce. Use `check_output` to help
encode your expectations about the output of your functions and catch bugs early!

Note (2): we can tag the `aggregation` features with whatever key value pair makes sense
for us to discern/identify that we should not compute these features in an online setting.
