""""
This is a simple example of a FastAPI server that uses Hamilton on the request
path to transform the data into features, and then uses a fake model to make
a prediction.

The assumption here is that you get all the raw data passed in via the request.

Otherwise for aggregration type features, you need to pass in a stored value
that we have mocked out with `load_invariant_feature_values`.
