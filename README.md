Hamilton is a general purpose Python library to author data transformations as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It enables users to write ETL pipelines, ML workflows, LLM applications, RAG systems, business analytics dashboards, webscrapers, and more! The [Hamilton UI](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/concepts/ui) allows to automatically visualize, catalog, and monitor execution.

Hamilton uses regular Python functions to define DAGs; you don't even need to `import hamilton` ! It uses the function name and parameters to resolve the graph. As shown below, functions specify their dependencies creating readable code that can always be visualized.

> ü§ñ Hamilton is great for DAGs. If you needs loops or conditional logic to create an LLM agent or a simulation take a look at our sister library  [Burr](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).


# Installation

Hamilton supports Python 3.8+. We include the optional `visualization` dependency to display our Hamilton DAG.

```bash
pip install "sf-hamilton[visualization]"
```

To use the Hamilton UI, install the `ui` and `sdk` dependencies.

```bash
pip install "sf-hamilton[ui,sdk]"
```

# Key Features

Data teams write code to deliver business value, but few have the resources to standardize practices and provide quality assurance. Moving from proof-of-concept to production, and cross-function collaboration (e.g., data science, engineering, ops) remain challenging for teams big or small.

Hamilton bakes-in solutions to support you throughout a project's lifecycle:

- **Built-in coding style**. Hamilton is built around Python functions encouraging  modular, easy to read, self-documenting, and unit testable code.

- **Maintainable DAG definitions**.

- **Portable transformations**. Your DAG is independent of instrastructure or orchestration, meaning you can develop and debug locally and reuse code across contexts (local, Airflow, FastAPI, etc.).

- **Separation of concerns**. Hamilton separates the DAG "definition" and "execution" which lets data scientists focus on solving problems and engineers manage production pipelines.

- **Low-friction dev to prod**. Use `@config.when()` to modify your DAG between execution environments instead of error-prone `if/else` feature flags. The notebook extension prevents the pain of migrating code from notebook to module.

- **Effective collaboration**. The Hamilton UI provides a shared interface that teams can use to inspect results and debug failures throughout the development cycle.

- **Built for plugins**. Hamilton is designed to play nice with all tools and provides the right abstractions to build custom integrations with your stack. Our community is active and very supportive.

- **Data and schema validation**. Decorate functions with `@check_output` to validate output properties, and raise warnings or exceptions. Add the `SchemaValidator()` adapter to automatically inspect dataframe-like objects (pandas, polars, Ibis, etc.) to track and validate their schema.


# Hamilton UI

You can track the execution of your Hamilton DAG in the Hamilton UI. It automatically populates a data catalog with lineage and provides execution observability to inspect results and debug errors. You can run it as a [local server](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/hamilton-ui/ui/#local-mode) or a [self-hosted application using Docker](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/hamilton-ui/ui/#docker-deployed-mode).

## Get started with the Hamilton UI

1. To use the Hamilton UI, install the dependencies (see `Installation` section) and start the server with

   ```bash
   hamilton ui
   ```

2. On the first connection, you will have to create a `username`. Then, create a new project and note the `project_id` (it should be `1`).

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/_static/new_project.png" alt="Create a project" width="70%"/>
</div>
<br>

3. Track your Hamilton DAG by create a `HamiltonTracker` object with your `username` and `project_id`. Now, all executions will be tracked and available from the UI!

   ```python
   from hamilton import driver
   from hamilton_sdk.adapters import HamiltonTracker
   import my_dag

   # use your `username` and `project_id`
   tracker = HamiltonTracker(
      username="my_username",
      project_id=1,
      dag_name="hello_world",
   )

   # building the `Driver` will add the DAG to the catalog
   dr = (
      driver.Builder()
      .with_modules(my_dag)
      .with_adapters(tracker)  # add your tracker here
      .build()
   )

   # executing the `Driver` will track results
   dr.execute(["C"])
   ```

# How does Hamilton compare to X?

Hamilton is not an orchestrator ([you might not need one](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/lean-data-automation-a-principal)) nor a feature store ([but you can use it to build one!](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/featurization-integrating-hamilton)). It's closest to dbt; it helps you structure and manage data transformations. While dbt is focus on SQL and data tables, Hamilton supports the full Python ecosystem and is great for machine learning pipelines, working with documents & LLMs, web requests, and more.

Another way to frame it is to think about the different layers of a data stack. Hamilton is at the **asset layer**. It helps you organize data transformations (the **expression layer**), manage changes, and validate & test data.
