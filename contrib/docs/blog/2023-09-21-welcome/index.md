Welcome to the Hamilton Dataflow Hub!

We're excited to kick off this project and hope that it will be a useful resource for the community.
Hamilton is like a Swiss army knife, it's very versatile, as you can use it for data, ML, LLM, and web work!

We envision this hub, as a place to share the flows you've built with it that can be useful to others!

## How to use

1. Browse the dataflows defined.
2. Find a dataflow you want to use.
3. Cut and paste the code snippet to get started with it!

## How to contribute
