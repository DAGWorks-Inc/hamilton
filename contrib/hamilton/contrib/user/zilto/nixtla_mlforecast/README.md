# Purpose of this module

This module implements forecasting using machine learning with `mlforecast` by Nixtla.

Fit and evaluate a list of models on a time series dataset. Obtain a cross-validation benchmark dataframe and prediction plots.

Your dataset needs to have columns `unique_id` to identify each series, `ds` to identify the time step, and `y` to specify the value of series `unique_id` at time `ds`.

# Configuration Options
## Config.when
This module doesn't receive configurations.

## Inputs
- `freq`: Adjust to meet the sampling rate of your time series
- `cross_validation_predictions()` and `inference_predictions()` share some arguments to provide consistency between evaluation and inference. Arguments that you might want to decouple are prefixed with `cv_` or `inference_` respectively.
- `target_transforms`: Pass a list of transforms to rescale, detrend, etc. your target and make it easier to fit and predict.
- ⚠ `num_threads`: Set the number of cores to use for compute. The default value `-1` will use all available cores and might slowdown the machine in the meantime.

## Overrides
- `base_models`: Create a list of sklearn-compatible models to fit and evaluate ([docs](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html))
- `lag_transforms` and `date_features`: Should be overriden to pass values relevant to your dataset
- `evaluation_metrics`: Set the list of Nixtla-compatible metrics to use during cross-validation ([examples](https://github.com/Nixtla/utilsforecast/blob/main/utilsforecast/losses.py))


# Limitations
- This module defines simple transforms as illustration. You should define relevant values
