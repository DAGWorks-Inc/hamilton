# Purpose of this module

This code is based on the example presented in
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/blob/main/content/tutorial-air-quality-analysis.md

What we've done here is made a dataflow of the computation required to do an AQI analysis.
It's very easy to change these functions for more sophisticated analysis, as well as to
change the inputs, etc.

Note: this code here is really to show you how to use pure numpy, not the best practices way of doing analysis.
In real-life practice you would probably do the following:
* The pandas library is preferable to use for time-series data analysis.
* The SciPy stats module provides the stats.ttest_rel function which can be used to get the t statistic and p value.
* In real life, data is generally not normally distributed. There are tests for such non-normal data like the
  Wilcoxon test.

You can download some data to use [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/main/examples/numpy/air-quality-analysis/air-quality-data.csv),
or download the following way:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/main/examples/numpy/air-quality-analysis/air-quality-data.csv
```

# Configuration Options
There is no configuration required for this dataflow. So pass in an empty dictionary.

# Limitations

None to really note.
