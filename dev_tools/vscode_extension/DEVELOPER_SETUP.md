# Developer setup

## Development
Install the dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

Edit the extension code and compile it

```sh
npm run compile
```

Alternatively, set it to auto rebuild on code changes with

```sh
npm run watch
```

Try the extension by pressing `F5` in VSCode. This will execute `npm run compile` and launch a temporary VSCode instance with the extension installed.

If you're using `npm run watch`, you use `CTRL+R` from the temporary VSCode instance to reload the extension, picking up the latest changes

## Release

The steps are detailed on the [official VSCode page](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension).

### Requirements
1. Install the `vsce` package using

    ```sh
    npm install -g @vscode/vsce
    ```

2. [Create a publisher account](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#create-a-publisher) for the VSCode Marketplace


### Manual publishing
1. Increment the `version` field in `package.json`. You can't publish to the Azure marketplace otherwise
2. Compile the TypeScript extension into JavaScript files. They can be found under `out/`

    ```sh
    npm run compile
    ```

3. Package the VSCode extension. This will bundle the code under `out/` and the `resources/` directory into a `.vsix` file.

    ```sh
    vsce package
    ```

4. (Optional) From the VSCode interface, you can right-click the `.vsix` file and select `Install Extension VSIX` to install and test it locally, outside the development environment.

5. Go to the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) and select `Publish extension`.

6. Upload the `.vsix` file and enter the required metadata. It should take ~5-10 mins for the marketplace to scan the files and make it publicly available.



### Programmatic publishing
1. Register your VSCode Marketplace access token

    ```sh
    vsce login
    ```

2. [Autoincrement releases](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#autoincrement-the-extension-version) and publish the extension.

    ```sh
    vsce publish [major|minor|patch] -p ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```
