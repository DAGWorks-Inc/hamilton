# Additional Tips
VSCode's flexible layout and keyboard shortcuts can improve the ergonomy of your workflow. Here's a few tips.

## Panels
In VSCode, the vertical sidebar is called the `activity bar` (`ctrl+b`) and the horizontal sidebar (where the terminal is) is called the `panel` (`ctrl+j`). There's also a vertical `secondary side bar` (`ctrl+alt+b`)

- **Tabs** found under the `activity bar` or the `panel` can be moved between the two.
- **Sections** found under a tab can be moved between **Tabs**.
- **Sections** can be folded by clicking the UI.
- The `activity bar` can be moved to the **left** or **right** via the setting `workbench.sideBar.location`
- The `panel` can be move to the **left**, **right**, or **bottom** by clicking the header and setting the `panel position`.
- The `panel` can be quickly open/closed with `ctrl+j`
- If you can't find a view, open the command palet and search for `Hamilton: Focus [...]` for shortcuts.
- If your setup becomes a mess, open the command palet and use `View: Reset View Locations`
