    Use this when you want to create a polars dataframe from the outputs. Caveat: you need to ensure that the length
    of the outputs is the same, otherwise you will get an error; mixed outputs aren't that well handled.

    To use:

    .. code-block:: python

        polars_builder = polars_extensions.PolarsLazyFrameResult()

        dr =  driver.Driver(config, *modules, adapter=adapter)
        df = dr.execute([...], inputs=...)  # returns polars dataframe

    Note: this is just a first attempt at something for Polars. Think it should handle more? Come chat/open a PR!
