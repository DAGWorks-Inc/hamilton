Getting Started
==============

Let's get started with Hamilton!

This is the tutorial section of the diataxis guide.
Most of this is taken by tryhamilton.dev but the purpose of this is to get someone comfortable running on their computer,
after they've seen the basics of the framework (or before, up to them).

- TODO -- add link to tryhamilton.dev
