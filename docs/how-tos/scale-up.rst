=====================
Run Hamilton at Scale
=====================

Hamilton enables a variety of tools for allowing you to scale your data processing by integrating with third-party libraries.

Specifically, we have three examples that show how to scale Hamilton both by parallelizing transformations (ray and dask) and running
on larger, distributed datasets (pandas on spark).

1. Integrating hamilton with `pandas on spark <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples/spark>`_.
2. Integrating hamilton with `ray <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples/ray>`_.
3. Integrating hamilton with `dask <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples/dask>`_.
