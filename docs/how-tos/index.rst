This portion of the documentation goes over the set of common examples for Hamilton usage, so you can apply
it to your day-to-day work. Each one corresponds to an example in the `examples <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples>`_
directory. If there's an example you want but don't see, reach out or open an issue on github -- we're always looking to add more.
