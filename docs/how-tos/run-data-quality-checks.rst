Run Data Quality Checks
=======================

Hamilton comes with data quality included out of the box.
While you can read more about this in the :doc:`API reference <../reference/decorators/index/>`, we have a few examples to help get you started.

The following two examples showcase a similar workflow, one using the vanilla hamilton data quality decorator, and the other using the pandera integration.
The goal of this is to show how to use runtime data quality checks in a larger, more complex ETL.

2. `Data quality with pandera <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples/data_quality/pandera>`_
