Run Hamilton in a Microservice
==============================

While we've mainly been discussing running Hamilton in a batch environment, it can easily be used
in a microservice/online setting. This is valuable if you want insight into exactly how your endpoints
transform/load data, or if you want to execute the same transforms you did in batch in an online setting.

The following example shows how to execute an asynchronous set of transforms in a microservice:

We will be releasing feature-specific examples shortly, as well.
