Materialization
===============

So far, we executed our dataflow using the ``Driver.execute()`` method, which can receive an ``inputs`` dictionary and return a ``results`` dictionary (by default). However, you can also execute code with ``Driver.materialize()`` to directly read from / write to external data sources (file, database, cloud data store).

On this page, you'll learn:

- The difference between ``.execute()`` and ``.materialize()``
- Why use materialization
- What are DataSaver and DataLoader objects
- The basics to write your own materializer

Different ways to write the same dataflow
-----------------------------------------

Below is the code and the visualization for 3 ways to write a dataflow that:

1. loads a dataframe from a parquet file
2. preprocesses the dataframe
3. trains a machine learning model
4. saves the trained model

The first two options use ``Driver.execute()`` and the latter ``Driver.materialize()``. Notice where in the code data artifacts are loaded and saved and how it affects the dataflow graph.

As explained previously, ``Driver.execute()`` walks the graph to compute the list of nodes you requested by name. For ``Driver.materialize()``, you give it a list of data savers (``from_``) and data loaders (``to``). Each one will add a node to the dataflow before execution.

.. note::

    ``Driver.materialize()`` can do everything ``Driver.execute()`` and more. It can receive ``inputs`` and ``overrides``. Instead of using ``final_vars``, you can use ``additional_vars`` to request nodes that you don't want to materialize/save.

Why use materialization
-----------------------

Let's compare the benefits of the 3 different approaches

Nodes / dataflow context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach defines data loading and saving as part of the dataflow and uses ``Driver.execute()``. It is usually the simplest approach and the one you should start with.

Benefits

- the functions ``raw_df()`` and ``save_model()`` are transparent as to how they load/save data
- can easily change data location using the strings ``data_path`` and ``model_dir`` as inputs
- All operations are part of the dataflow

Limitations

- need to write a unique function for each loaded parquet file and saved model. Code duplication could be reduced by using utility functions ``_load_parquet()``
- data location is hard coded and difficult to change. Could override ``raw_df`` in the ``.execute()`` call.

Driver context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach loads and saves data outside the dataflow and uses ``Driver.execute()``. Since the Driver is responsible for executing your dataflow, it makes sense to handle data loading/saving in this context if they change often.

Benefits

- Flexibility for Driver users to change data location
- Fewer dataflow functions to define and maintain.

Limitations

- Adds complexity to the Driver code (e.g., ``run.py``).
- Lose the Hamilton benefits of having data loading and saving part of the dataflow (visualize, lifecycle hook, etc.)
- If data loading/saving needs flexibility, adopt approach the **nodes/dataflow context** approach with ``@config`` for alternative implementations (see :ref:`config-decorators`).

.. note::

    Notice that the **Driver context** approach is equivalent to the **nodes/dataflow context** if you add to this Driver a separate Python module with the functions ``raw_df()`` and ``save_model()``

Materialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach tries to strike a balance between the two previous methods and uses ``Driver.materialize()``.


Unique benefits

- Use the Hamilton logic to combine nodes (more on that later)
- Get tested code for common data loading and saving out-of-the-box (e.g., JSON, CSV, Parquet, pickle)
- Easily save the same node to multiple formats

Benefits

- Flexibility for Driver users to change data location
- Less dataflow functions to define and maintain
- All operations are part of the dataflow

Limitations

- Writing a custom DataSaver or DataLoader requires more effort than adding a function to the dataflow.
- Adds complexity to the Driver (e.g., ``run.py``).


DataLoader and DataSaver
------------------------

In Hamilton, ``DataLoader`` and ``DataSaver`` are classes that define how to load or save a particular data format. Calling ``Driver.materialize(DataLoader(), DataSaver())`` adds nodes to the dataflow (see visualizations above).

Here are simplified snippets for saving and loading an XGBoost model to JSON.

   +----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | DataLoader                                   | DataSaver                                     |
   +==============================================+===============================================+
   | .. literalinclude:: _snippets/data_loader.py | .. literalinclude:: _snippets/data_saver.py   |
   |                                              |                                               |
   +----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

To define your own DataSaver and DataLoader, the Hamilton `XGBoost extension <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/blob/main/hamilton/plugins/xgboost_extensions.py>`_ is a good example

``@load_from`` and ``@save_to``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also, the data loaders and savers power the ``@load_from`` and ``@save_to`` :ref:`loader-saver-decorators`
