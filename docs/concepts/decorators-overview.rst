Overview of Decorators
======================


While the one to one mapping of node -> function implementation is powerful, it can sometimes lead to repeated code. In
order to minimize this, Hamilton employs decorators to promote reuse of business logic. In this section we will go over a
few different classes of decorators with some examples. For reference on specific decorators, see
:doc:`../../reference/decorators/index`.

In Hamilton, decorators allow the author of Hamilton dataflows to modify functions as well as their role in the DAG.
Decorators do one (or multiple) of the following:

Determine if a function should be included
------------------------------------------

``@config.when`` is the primary example of this. It allows the user to determine nodes that are only present in certain
DAG configurations. For instance, say that your company has different marketing spend source in different geographic
regions. You might write code that looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from hamilton.function_modifiers import config

    @config.when(region='US')
    def marketing_spend(tv_spend: pd.Series, billboard_spend: pd.Series):
        return tv_spend + billboard_spend

    @config.when(region='CA')
    def marketing_spend(tv_spend: pd.Series, radio_spend: pd.Series):
        return tv_spend + radio_spend

With the code above, the implementation of ``marketing_spend`` will depend on whether the DAG of transforms is compiled
with the region set to the US or Canada.

Specify the implementation of a function
----------------------------------------

The function doesn't have to specify everything about the transform. In fact, with the ``@does`` decorator, it can be
left empty! The above can be reduced even further...

.. code-block:: python

    import functools
    import operators

    from hamilton.function_modifiers import config, does

    def _sum_series(**series: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
        return functools.reduce(operators.add, series.values())

    @config.when(region='US')
    @does(_sum_series)
    def marketing_spend(tv_spend: pd.Series, billboard_spend: pd.Series):
        pass

    @config.when(region='CA')
    @does(_sum_series)
    def marketing_spend(tv_spend: pd.Series, radio_spend: pd.Series):
        pass

Note that we have no implementation for the functions! They're automagically replaced. There are other decorators that
similar things.

Split the function into multiple nodes
--------------------------------------

In order to reduce duplicated code, Hamilton has decorators that allow a single function to output multiple nodes. These
can be incredibly powerful. Take, for example, the extract\_columns decorator. In this case, let's say that we have all
the source spend in a big dataframe, and want to split it out into multiple columns, so the above can read it. One might
write the following:

.. code-block:: python

    import functools
    import operators

    from hamilton.function_modifiers import extract_columns

    @extract_columns(['tv_spend', 'radio_spend', 'billboard_spend'])
    def marketing_spend_df() -> pd.DataFrame:
        return load_all_marketing_spend_from_external_source()

The ``marketing_spend_df`` function becomes three separate available datums from the pipeline. Note it actually provides
a fourth, as the original node itself is added so the computation is not rerun. ``@extract_columns`` works specifically
only over dataframes. In fact, it will break if you try it on a function annotated with the wrong type. The other most
widely used transform is ``@parametrized``.

While there are decorators that don't quite fit into the above, these should give you a sense of how and why decorators
are used. For more information on available decorators, see: :doc:`../reference/decorators/index`.
