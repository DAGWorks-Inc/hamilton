Custom Driver
=============

If you have a use case for a custom Driver, tell us on `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/hamilton-opensource/shared\_invite/zt-1bjs72asx-wcUTgH7q7QX1igiQ5bbdcg>`_
or via a `GitHub issues <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=>`__. Knowing about your use case and talking through help ensures we aren't duplicating effort, and that it'll be using part of the API we don't intend to change.
