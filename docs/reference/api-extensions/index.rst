Currently a few of the API extensions are still experimental. Note this doesn't mean they're not well-tested or thought out --
rather that we're actively looking for feedback. More docs upcoming, but for now fish around the
`experimental package <https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/tree/main/hamilton/experimental>`_, and give the
extensions a try!

The other extensions live within `plugins <https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/tree/main/hamilton/plugins>`_. These are
fully supported and will be backwards compatible across major versions.
