Here lies documentation for the public API you can build on top of.

See :doc:`decorators` to increase Hamilton functionality, in addition to ways to keep your code DRY.

See :doc:`result-builders` for what comes out of the box for determining how to construct a return type from
``execute``.

See :doc:`graph-adapters` for ways to execute Hamilton.

See :doc:`drivers` for how to call and instantiate a Hamilton dataflow. Right now there are only two!

See :doc:`disabling-telemetry` for how to disable telemetry.
