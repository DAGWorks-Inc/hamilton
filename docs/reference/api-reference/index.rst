Here lies documentation for the public API you can build on top of.

See :doc:`available-decorators` to increase Hamilton functionality, in addition to ways to keep your code DRY.

See :doc:`available-drivers` for how to call and instantiate a Hamilton dataflow. Right now there is only one!

See :doc:`available-result-builders` for what comes out of the box for determining how to construct a return type from
``execute``.

See :doc:`available-graph-adapters` for ways to execute Hamilton.
