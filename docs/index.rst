The open source framework `Hamilton <https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton>`_, originally built to manage and run Stitch
Fix's data pipelines.

.. _what is hamilton:

What is Hamilton?
-----------------

It's a general purpose micro-framework for creating `dataflows <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow>`_ from python
functions!

Specifically, Hamilton defines a novel paradigm, that allows you to specify a flow of (delayed) execution, that forms a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It was original built to solve creating wide (1000+) column dataframes at Stitch Fix. Core
to the design of Hamilton is a clear mapping of function name to dataflow output. That is, Hamilton forces a certain
paradigm with writing functions, and aims for DAG clarity, easy modifications, *with always unit testable and naturally
documentable code!*

For the backstory on how Hamilton came about, see our
`blog post <https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2021/10/14/functions-dags-hamilton/>`_!

Hamilton's method of defining dataflows presents a new paradigm when it comes to creating, um, dataframes (let's use
dataframes as an example, otherwise you can create *ANY* python object). Rather than thinking about manipulating a
central dataframe procedurally, and extracting the data you want, as is normal in some data engineering/data science
work, you instead think about the column(s) (a.k.a. outputs) you want to create, and what inputs are required.
There is no need for you to think about maintaining how to create this dataframe, meaning you do not need to think
about any "glue" code; this is all taken care of by the Hamilton framework. Specifically, Hamilton enables you to run
your dataflow with the following steps:

1. Define your dataflow (a.k.a. pipeline), as a set of transforms using Hamilton's paradigm for writing python functions.
2. Specify the parameter values your dataflow requires
3. Specify which outputs you want to compute from your dataflow

The rest is delegated to the framework, which handles the computation for you.

Let's illustrate this with some code. If you were asked to write a simple transform (let's use pandas for the sake of
argument), you may decide to write something simple like this:

.. code-block:: python

    df['col_c'] = df['col_a'] + df['col_b']

To represent this in a way Hamilton can understand, you write:

.. code-block:: python

    def col_c(col_a: pd.Series, col_b: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
        """Creating column c from summing column a and column b."""
        return col_a + col_b

    :alt: The above code represented as a diagram

The Hamilton framework takes the above code, forms it into a computational DAG, and executes it for you!
