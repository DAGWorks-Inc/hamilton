Hamilton is a general-purpose framework to write dataflows using regular Python functions. At the core, each function defines a transformation and its parameters indicates its dependencies. Hamilton automatically connects individual functions into a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) that can be executed, visualized, optimized, and reported on.
Hamilton also comes with a [UI](hamilton-ui/index.rst) to visualize, catalog, and monitor your dataflows.

The ABC of Hamilton

# Why should you use Hamilton?
**Facilitate collaboration**. By focusing on functions, Hamilton avoids sprawling code hierarchy and generates flat dataflows. Well-scoped functions make it easier to add features, complete code reviews, debug pipeline failures, and hand-off projects. Visualizations can be generated directly from your code to better understand and document it.
Integration with the [Hamilton UI](hamilton-ui/index.rst) allows you to track lineage, catalog code & artifacts, and monitor your dataflows.

**Reduce development time**. Hamilton dataflows are reusable across projects and context (e.g., pipeline vs. web service). The benefits of developing robust and well-tested solutions are multiplied by reusability. Off-the-shelf dataflows are available on the [Hamilton Hub](https://hub.dagworks.io/).

**Own your platform**. Hamilton helps you integrate the frameworks and tools of your stack. Hamilton's features are easy to extend and customize to your needs. This flexibility enables self-serve designs and ultimately reduces the risks of vendor lock-in.

**Scale your dataflow**. Hamilton separates transformation logic from execution, allowing you to seamlessly scale via remote execution (AWS, Modal, etc.) and specialized computation engines (Spark, Ray, duckdb etc.). Hamilton was battle tested under intensive enterprise data workloads.

Here's a quick overview of benefits that Hamilton provides as compared to other tools:

# Architecture Overview

The following diagram gives a simplified overview of the main components of Hamilton.

**Functions & Module**. Transformations are regular Python functions organized into modules. Functions must be type-annotated, but hold no dependency with Hamilton and can be reused outside of it.

**Driver & FunctionGraph**. The `Driver` will automatically assemble the `FunctionGraph` from the modules given. The `Driver` can be configured to modify and extend the execution behavior (e.g., remote execution, monitoring, webhooks, caching).

**Visualization**. The `FunctionGraph` can be visualized without executing code. This coupling ensures visualizations always match the code from modules.

**Execution**. When requesting variables, the `Driver` establishes an execution plan to only compute the required functions. Then, results are gathered and returned to the user.
