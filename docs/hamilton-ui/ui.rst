--------------------
UI Overview
--------------------

Hamilton comes with a fully open-source UI that can be run both for local deployment and on a remote server.
The UI consists of the following features:

1. Telemetry for hamilton executions -- both on the history of executions and the data itself.
2. A feature/artifact catalog for browsing/connecting executions of nodes -> results.
3. A dataflow (i.e. DAG) visualizer for exploring and looking at your code, and determining lineage.
4. A project explorer for viewing curating projects and viewing versions of your Hamilton dataflows.

In short, the Hamilton UI aims to combine a large swath of MLOps/data observability systems in one simple application.

The Hamilton UI has two modes:
1. Run locally using sqlite3
2. Run on docker images with postgres (meant for deployment)

----------
Local Mode
----------

To run the hamilton UI in local mode, you can do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install `hamilton[ui]`
    hamilton ui

This will launch a browser window in localhost:8241. You can then navigate to the UI and start using it!
While this can potentially handle a small production workflow, you may want to run on postgres with a separate frontend/backend/db
for full scalability and a multi-read/write db.

--------------------
Docker/Deployed Mode
--------------------

The Hamilton UI can be contained within a set of Docker images. You launch with `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_, and it will start up the UI, the backend server,
and a Postgres database. If you'd like a quick overview of some of the features, you can watch the following:

If you'd like a video walkthrough on getting set up, you can watch the following:

As prerequisites, you will need to have Docker installed -- you can follow instructions  `here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_.

1. Clone the Hamilton repository locally

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton

2. Navigate to the ``hamilton/ui`` directory

.. code-block:: bash

    cd hamilton/ui


3. Execute the installation script with the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    ./deployment/run.sh


This will:

- Pull all Docker images from the Docker Hub
- Start a local Postgres database
- Start the backend server
- Start the frontend server

This takes a bit of time! So be patient. The server will be running on port 8242.

4. Then navigate to ``http://localhost:8242`` in your browser, and enter your email (this will be the username used within the app).

Building the Docker Images locally
-----------------------------------
If building the Docker containers from scratch, increase your Docker memory to 10gb or more -- you can do this in the Docker Desktop settings.

To build the images locally, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    # from the hamilton/ui directory
    ./deployment/dev.sh --build

This will build the containers from scratch. If you just want to mount the local code, you can run just

.. code-block:: bash

    ./deployment/dev.sh

Self-Hosting
-------------

Please reach out to us if you want to deploy on your own infrastructure. Self-hosting documentation will be up soon.


-----------
Get started
-----------

Now that you have your server running, you can run a simple dataflow and watch it in the UI!
You can follow instructions in the UI when you create a new project, or follow the instructions here.

First, install the SDK:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "sf-hamilton[sdk]"

Then, navigate to the project page (dashboard/projects), in the running UI, and click the green ``+ New DAG`` button.

.. image:: ../_static/new_project.png

Remember the project ID -- you'll use it for the next steps.

Existing Hamilton Code
----------------------
Add the following adapter to your code if you have existing Hamilton code:

.. code-block:: python

    from hamilton_sdk import adapters

    tracker = adapters.HamiltonTracker(
       project_id=PROJECT_ID_FROM_ABOVE,
       username="EMAIL_YOU_PUT_IN_THE_UI",
       dag_name="my_version_of_the_dag",
       tags={"environment": "DEV", "team": "MY_TEAM", "version": "X"}
    )

    dr = (
      driver.Builder()
        .with_config(your_config)
        .with_modules(*your_modules)
        .with_adapters(tracker)
        .build()
    )

Then run your DAG, and follow the links in the logs!

I need some Hamilton code to run
--------------------------------
If you don't have Hamilton code to run this with, you can run Hamilton UI example under `examples/hamilton_ui <https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples/hamilton_ui>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    # we assume you're in the Hamilton repository root
    cd examples/hamilton_ui
    # make sure you have the right python packages installed
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # run the pipeline providing the email and project_id you created in the UI
    python run.py --email <email> --project_id <project_id>

You should see links in the `logs to the UI <http://localhost:8242/dashboard/projects>`_, where you can see the DAG run + the data summaries captured.

----------
Features
----------

Once you get to the UI, you can navigate to the projects page (left hand nav-bar). Assuming you have created a project
and logged to it, you can then navigate to view it and then more details about it. E.g. versions, code, lineage, catalog, execution runs.
See below for a few screenshots of the UI.
